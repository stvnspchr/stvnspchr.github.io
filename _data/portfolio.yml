  description:  The Platte Basin Timelapse project aims to tell the story of our water in the heart of the continent. I outlined and proposed a move to WordPress CMS, designed and developed the theme, trained journalists on publishing for the web, and contributed to reporting and design/development efforts with data visualizations and multimedia stories.

- title: Central Platte River Mapping Imagery
  description: As part of the Into the Current report our team published, I developed a series of comparison graphics that helped to visual the story of landscape change and conservation effort in the central Platte valley. I worked the US Fish and Wildlife Service to acquire USGS stitched  imagery and then used ArcMap to color, compare, and render mapping tiles. The imagery was used to create slippy map tiles and still imagery for slider graphics.

- title: Chimney Swifts - A Community Project
  description: Lincoln's Irving Middle School was just around the corner from my home and hosted one of the largest roosts of migratory Chimney Swifts in eastern Nebraska. In collaboration with a local wildlife photographer, a science educator, and the neighborhood school, I helped start an effort to document and educate the public and students about the wildlife in our own backyard.

- title: Flows in Nebraska
  description:  The Platte River flows through the middle of Nebraska, the lifeline of the state, providing water for agriculture, wildlife habitat, and thirsty cities. Unlike many streams in the U.S., prairie rivers fluctuate wildly. This visualization helps to see these changes through time.

- title: The 100th Meridian in Nebraska
  description:  In the central Great Plains, the 100th meridian roughly marks the western boundary of the normal reach of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, the boundary between the semi-arid climate to the west and the humid continental climates to the east. For a graduate level course in GIS, I visualized the distribution of land uses this straight line.

  description: For a story published in the University of Wyoming's <a href='http://www.westernconfluence.org/'>Western Confluence Magazine</a> issue 3, I designed a map showing the surface irrigated land in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. The map was used in both print and digital publications.

- title: Mormon Island Panoramas
  description: I returned to Mormon Island in central Nebraska several times a year to photograph environmental and prairie change. From a series of 10 vertical images, I created these panoramas. This prairie ecosystem is critically important for migrating and resident wildlife. Hydrologically connected to the nearby Platte River, this tract of land is carefully management by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cranetrust.org/">The Crane Trust</a> with a rotation of grazing, fire, and rest.
