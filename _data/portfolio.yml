- title: Flows in Nebraska
  description:  The Platte River flows through the middle of Nebraska, the lifeline of the state, providing water for agriculture, wildlife habitat, and thirsty cities. Unlike many streams in the U.S., prairie rivers fluctaute wildly. This visualization helps to see these changes through time.

- title: The 100th Meridian in Nebraska
  description:  In the central Great Plains, the 100th meridian roughly marks the western boundary of the normal reach of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico, the boundary between the semi-arid climate to the west and the humid continental climates to the east. For a gradute level course in GIS, I visualized the distribution of landuses this straight line.

- title: Western Confluence Magazine - Irrigation Map Design
  description: For a story published in the University of Wyoming's <a href='http://www.westernconfluence.org/'>Western Confluence Magazine</a> issue 3, I designed a map showing the surface irrigated land in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska. The map was used in both print and digital publications. See the map on page 6 in the online version of the magazine <a href='http://www.westernconfluence.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/western-confluence-issue-03-web.pdf'>here</a>.

- title: Mormon Island Panoramas
  description: I returned to Mormon Island in central Nebraska several times a year to photograph environmental and prairie change. From a series of 10 vertical images, I created these panoramas. This prairie ecosystem is critically important for migrating and resident wildlife. Hydrologically connected to the nearby Platte River, this tract of land is carefully management by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cranetrust.org/">The Crane Trust</a> with a rotation of grazing, fire, and rest.
