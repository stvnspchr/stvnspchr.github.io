- title: Central Platte River Mapping Imagery
  description: As part of the Into the Current report our team published, I developed a series of comparison graphics that helped to visual the story of landscape change and conservation effort in the central Platte valley. I worked the US Fish and Wildlife Service to acquire USGS stitched  imagery and then used ArcMap to color, compare, and render mapping tiles. The imagery was used to create slippy map tiles and still imagery for slider graphics.
