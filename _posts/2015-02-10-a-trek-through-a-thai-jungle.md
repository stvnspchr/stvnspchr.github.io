Doi Inthanon National Park is 60 km south of Chiang Mai, inhabited by 4,500 Karen and Meo Hmong villagers. These hill tribes rely on the steep-sloped rainforests and a mix of modern and traditional agricultural practices. With the aid of a trekking guide and a couple of local Karen villagers, we spent the entire day learning about traditional foraging, herbalism, and jungle survival.

###### Our guide, Joc. A native of the Thai jungles, he was a wealth of information on local flora and fauna, regularly pointing out shrubs and trees used for medicinal and nutritional purposes. Here, he’s showing us a vanilla plant grown as a part of a national agricultural project.

###### Flowers growing in hoop houses. We first walked through the Royal Agricultural Project. A 20 year project dedicated to modernizing, diversifying, and educating local villagers on agricultural techniques.

###### Pooh’s dog was our security escort in the jungle. He followed us through the day, occasionally darting off to investigate. He’s very friendly and discernibly loyal.

###### Wheat in foreground and various flowers in background. This area previously grew opium and poverty was pervasive. There’s still a lot of work to do in the area but much of the produce and flowers grown here are highly desired in cities in the valley below, like Chiang Mai and and even Bangkok, providing income for local villagers.

###### Trekking through the Doi Inthanon National Park. We were in the shadow of Doi Inthanon, Thailand’s highest mountain at 2,565 m (8,415 ft) most of the day.

###### Our guides were enormously knowledgable of the local flora. They regularly identified important medicinal and herbal plants, providing opportunity for smells and tastes (i.e. cinnamon, lemongrass,  agarwood,  blackboard tree).

###### “We stop here for lunch.” We had carried with us a few bananas, pineapple, mushrooms, eggs, chicken, pork, and a machete. All else was gathered on site.

###### The guides gathered large banana tree leaves, using them as cutting boards.

###### Sliced bamboo was used to create a spit, fastened with bamboo ties.

###### Bamboo is an enormously useful plant. It is edible, resiliently strong, and readily available.

###### The guides folded together several banana leaves to create a cooking vessel, used to cook the eggs and a dish created from the flower of the banana.

###### The banana leaf satchels were fastened with bamboo ties to another bamboo spit.

###### Within 15 minutes of arriving at our lunch spot, the guides had a fire cracking and a handcrafted rotisserie.

###### While waiting for our meals to cook, Allison made friends with our canine escort.

###### A banana leaf table and place setting, fitting etiquette for a jungle meal.

###### The banana flower dish, wrapped and cooked in its own leaves. Save for a bit of water and seasoning, this entire dish was gathered on site.

###### A jungle meal

###### Our group, satiated.

###### Post-meal, we continued our hike, finding a gorgeous waterfall.

![End of trek]({{ site.assets }}trekking-blog/img_5534.jpg)
###### Our trek ended at a Karen village. We emerged from the jungle to a beautiful vista of rice paddy, wheat, and passion fruit hillsides.

###### Out from under the canopy, continued shade was welcomed. Slash-and-burn agriculture is still very popular with many villages. By late February and throughout March, the entire hillside hides under a blanket of smoke. The valley below, including Chiang Mai, is said to have some of the worst respiratory issues during this time of year.
