<h3>What is Art?</h3>

					<p>One of the fundamental questions asked of aestheticians is “what is art?”. For decades, philosophers have pondered the question and posed theories in an attempt to define a set of necessary and sufficient conditions classifying an object as a work of art. Several classes of theory have emerged in the inquiry of the term ‘artwork.’ Imitation theories, expression theories, formalist theories, institutional theories and theories of ‘open concept’ definitions of art, the object of this discussion. My proposition is that George Dickie’s institutional theory of art failed in its attempt to set necessary and sufficient conditions for the definition of art dissolving his argument to that of Morris Weitz, which he tried to distinguish himself from. First, let us briefly investigate Weitz’ claims and Dickie’s relation to his argument.</p>

					<p>Arguing in post-Wittgensteinian times, Weitz proposed a theory of art in opposition to the traditional methodology of identifying an artwork. His theory used Wittgenstein’s family resemblance argument to make the case that art is an ‘open concept’ incapable of a set of necessary and sufficient conditions. It is possible to extend the characterization of a work of art in an infinite number of directions and in unpredictable ways. Written in Weitz’ famous “The Role of Theory in Aesthetics,” this proposal once again sparked debate in the philosophical community to the question of “what is art?” that had been somewhat of a dying inquisition. Dickie, working a few decades after this resurgence, was able to observe the tales of inquiry and formalized a set of phases placing his work in the context of the others. Dickie’s Phase I consisted of the traditional endeavors such as institutional theories and expression theories that posed necessary and sufficient conditions for indentifying an artwork but ultimately failed by simply describing what an artwork may be like or do. Phase II is the somewhat recent movement of philosophers being persuaded in the futility of trying to define art. Wittgensteinian ideas of concepts primarily informed these times leading to Weitz’ open concept of art theory. Phase III, as supplied by Dickie, was to avoid the difficulties of the traditional definitions in Phase I but to incorporate the analyses of Phase II insights. Phase III was to be the best of both worlds, you could say. Let us expose Dickie’s deviation from Weitz and his consequential argument.</p>

					<p>Dickie’s essay defining the nature of an artwork specifies its exact intent. There are three senses of a work of art—the primary or classificatory sense, the secondary or derivative sense and the evaluative sense. His essay only concerns itself with the primary sense or the classificatory sense. That is, the set of necessary and sufficient conditions that Dickie argues for can be only used to identify an object as a work of art. This does not mean that that object must be a <i>good</i> work of art; that is left for the evaluative sense. When someone makes the claim that an object is a work of art, the extent of his or her claim is merely that. They are <i>not</i> demanding that that object must be a good work of art, or that it successfully communicates emotion, or that it is an accurate representation of some reality. These inquiries are left to the Phase I endeavors such as the expression theory and imitation theory.</p>

					<p>Let us now begin by identifying Dickie’s final definition of a work of art as it appears in his essay, “What is Art? An Institutional Analysis,” and then we may unpack it.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 15px; margin-left: 25px;">A work of art in the classificatory sense is (1) an artifact (2) a set of the aspects of which has been conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting on behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld).</p>

					<p>We should define two terms that Dickie uses in his definition—‘artifact’ and the ‘artworld.’ An object becomes an artifact when it has been worked on by human hands. All paradigmatic cases of artwork are easily given the quality of artifactuality; a painting, sculpture, photograph, novel, poem, play, musical score, etc. are all readily accepted to have been touched by a human hand thus deserving being declared an artifact. Where Dickie’s claim for an artwork maintaining artifactuality differs is that of the natural artwork or ‘driftwood cases.’ In the classificatory sense of artwork, the ‘driftwood case’ is not a work of art because it has not been touched by the human hand. The driftwood may be photographed, painted, replicated or moved to a gallery or desk to earn the status of artifactuality but, until sufficient means of this, the object remains not an artifact. But we do say that the ‘driftwood case’ may still be a work of art. When we say this, we mean that it is art in the secondary sense or evaluative sense. The driftwood is not art in the classificatory sense but is a derivation of that. The driftwood may also be pleasing to look at and may be called ‘art’ but this is in fact only stating that it is pleasing and not deserving of the status a work of art, just as we might say “her cakes are works of art.”</p>

					<p>In the second condition, Dickie uses a term originally applied by Danto—the ‘artworld.’ The artworld is a broad social institution consisting of a bundle of systems: theatre, painting, sculpture, literature, music, film and so on. There is no limit to the number of systems in the artworld and each system may also have a group of subsystems. The institutionalism of the artworld differs from the understood definition of the term ‘institution.’ The artworld is an institution of an <i>established</i> <i>practice</i> not an established society or corporation. Those considered in the artworld are artists, producers, curators, museum-goers, theatre-goers, art reporters for the newspaper, art critics, art historians, art theorists, philosophers and others. We will go into greater detail of the artworld later.</p>

					<p>It is with these two terms and two necessary and sufficient conditions that Dickie’s answer to the question “what is art?” becomes possible. The radical creativity, adventuresomeness and exuberance of art which Weitz argued for with the open concept of art is possible even though it is closed by the artifactuality and conferred status on behalf of the artworld.</p>

					<p>I would like to argue that Dickie’s two necessary and sufficient conditions are borderless and do not successfully close the classificatory sense of artwork. His conditions fail to tightly close the normative evaluation of an object equating his argument to that of Weitz’ open concept of art. I would like to make it clear that I am not going to be arguing <i>against</i> Dickie’s institutional theory of art but rather that his analysis does not provide sufficient grounds to distinguish himself from Weitz’ claim that art is an open concept. It may very well be the case that Dickie’s theory best exemplifies art’s ‘definition’ as an open concept but his theory does not successfully define a set of necessary and sufficient conditions with which to classify an object a work of art.</p>

					<p>Artifactuality is a quite simple component of Dickie’s argument. In fact, it is so simple it is almost irrelevant to mention but, in looking at some strange cases and exploring the term, we may be able to draw out the apparent futility in its inclusion in Dickie’s conditions. I think it is safe to say that most paradigmatic cases of art are easily accepted to be artifacts. It may not be completely obvious that music qualifies as an artifact in the accepted terminology of artifact, but, in Dickie’s definition of artifact, music has been constructed by a human endeavor and thus deserves the status of artifact. Debate in this arena is left to other philosophers such as Levinson; our concerns are with the cases existing on the edges. As mentioned before, the artifactuality of an object is ambiguous in the natural cases or ‘driftwood cases.’ As beautifully arranged as it may be, a piece of driftwood found on the beach is not an artifact. Dickie says that the driftwood earns artifact (and thus artwork) status only when brought into a museum. The act of moving the driftwood is the grounds of earning artifactuality. What if the driftwood was only rearranged by the human hand, even in the slightest way? Or what if the driftwood was unintentional moved when I tripped over it? Does the work of the human hand need to be intentional? These questions lead to deeper questions of the exact intent of the artifactuality clause. The paradigmatic cases of art are accepted to be artifacts so why include this condition for the periphery cases. It turns out, the artifactuality condition is tied in to the second condition of conferring status on the object. </p>

					<p>It may be the case that the artifactuality of an object only comes from the movement of the object to a position of being capable of being appreciative as if it were an artwork. The artifactuality of the object is created when the object has been conferred the status of artwork and this may be the only real implication Dickie purported when including the artifactuality condition to the definition of art. Imagine you are walking down the beach and you see a seashell. It is perfectly in tact; clean from being washed over by the water; a beautiful color of brown, tan, white and black. You decide you would like to bring it back to your house to put on your mantel wishing to, at some point, present the seashell to your friends and family. At this point, the object cannot be a work of art because it has not yet been worked on by human hands. But in your mind, you have conferred it the status of an artwork that you wish to present to others. The physical act of <i>picking up</i> the seashell is the act of the conferring artwork status of the seashell while also simultaneously giving status of artifactuality to the seashell. It might also be the case that you pick up the seashell then decide to present in on your mantel. In this case, the artifactuality is independent of conferring status but it is not impossible at all to imagine the previous case. In the first scenario, the picking up of the seashell is meaningless in the conditional definition of the status of the seashell as a work of art. It is merely the physical act of conferring the status of an object as a work of art.</p>

					<p>The much more complicated requirement for an object’s status as a work of art is Dickie’s second condition. Let me remind you of Dickie’s definition.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 15px; margin-left: 25px;">A work of art in the classificatory sense is (1) an artifact (2) a set of the aspects of which has been conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting on behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld).</p>

					<p>Dickie points out four interconnected notions that make up the second condition—(1) acting on behalf of an institution, (2) conferring status, (3) being a candidate and (4) appreciation. The third and forth notion we have already discussed. Defining art in the classificatory sense only claims an object being a <i>candidate</i> for appreciation. The object is only an artwork in the classificatory sense, which is defined by the second two notions. The first two explain how this happens.</p>

					<p>What does it mean to be acting on behalf of the artworld, the institution responsible for conferring status of an artifact? As defined before, the artworld consists of artists, producers, curators, museum-goers, theatre-goers, art reporters for the newspaper, art critics, art historians, art theorists, philosophers and others. “<i>Every person who sees himself as a member of the artworld is thereby a member”</i> (431). The obvious implication for this statement is that <i>anyone</i> can be in the artworld. No credentials are necessary; no training is necessary; no strong connection to the ‘institution<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref" title="" style="font-size: 12px;">[1]</a>’ of art is necessary. This gives enormous power to the later task of conferring status. Dickie does seem to try to pick up some of this looseness. The theatre-goer is not just someone who happens to enter a theatre; he is a person who enters with certain expectations and knowledge about what he will experience and an understanding of how he should behave in the face of what he will experience. What these certain expectations are seems elusive and difficult to distinguish in Dickie’s argument, especially understanding the claim that anyone who thinks they are part of the artworld is part of the artworld. It would seem that if someone entered a theatre, with the knowledge of entering a theatre, they might consider themselves part of the artworld thus becoming part of the artworld. What the case may exclude is someone who <i>accidentally</i> wanders into the theatre without any sort of knowledge of what the theatre may be. This case might occur but seems unlikely due to the nature of theatres and other art exhibition related events (ticket-takers, security, high price). Generally, someone who enters a theatre must be part of the artworld.</p>

					<p>Now that we have identified the artworld as a probable infinite social institution of those that consider themselves part of, we may consider the power of such an institution and, in the case of the individual, the conferring status of an artifact. What does it mean to confer status of an object? As I have said before in the ‘driftwood cases’, it may be linked to the act of <i>picking up</i> an object. Dickie has a similar story; the best examples of conferring the status of an object are legal actions by the state. The action, as exemplified by Dickie, is the king’s conferring of knighthood. The action of conferring status as a candidate for appreciation is in the same manner as being knighted. The power to confer status to a work of art can be performed by one person. As Dickie points out, this one person may be the artist him or herself. In fact, many works of art are only seen by the artist themselves. The obvious implication of this is that any artist who creates, creates art. There seems to be no closed end with which one could say a work of art begins and ends.</p>

					<p>Now this seems to lead to an infinitely unclassifiable case of what is a work of art. It is conceivable to imagine an individual claiming his right sock to be art. This would be in his power because, presumably, he must be thinking himself to be in the artworld to make a claim dealing with art. Now were the sock to end up in a museum it must be art. I think many, including many in the artworld, would find the claiming of a sock to be classified a work of art and rather conspicuous, open interpretation of the meaning of a work of art. Though it satisfy Dickie’s conditions, the inclusion of the sock in a museum makes one ask the question, ‘what <i>really</i> is art?’ and maybe even the question Weitz purported, ‘what kind of concept is art?’. Anyone that thinks they are part of the artworld is part of the artworld. Presumably, someone could think of themselves as an artist and become an artist. An artist can create any sort of object, thus becoming an artifact, and then dub the artifact a work of art. This seems to be at least one of the implications of Dickie’s necessary and sufficient conditions in the task of classifying a work of art. </p>

					<p>It is apparent to me that this standard contains no reachable borders at all. Anyone can create anything and it can become a work of art. It <i>may</i> be the case that Dickie’s necessary and sufficient conditions close the classificatory sense of art, but those boundaries would in fact <i>never</i> be found, dissolving them to a state of arbitrariness. The status of artifactuality and candidacy for appreciation fail to exclude anything. Dickie’s resulting argument is not one of a closed definition of art, but one that encourages an open concept of art that has no evident boundaries.</p>

					<p>I think that there are at least two conclusions we can draw from these considerations. One is that, as Weitz argued for, the task of any attempt to provide an essential definition for the classificatory sense of art is doomed for failure. Not completely agreeing with Weitz, we may not be <i>certain</i> of the inevitability of the open definition of art, but at least any project aimed at defining the necessary and sufficient conditions for a work of art must take into high consideration the truthful claims of the open nature of art. While Dickie certainly entertains the open nature of art, maybe the approaches of Carroll’s historical narrative or variations of Weitz’ concepts of art are best suited in bounding the classificatory sense of art. Again, we may not be <i>certain</i> of the open nature of art, but every bit of my intuition says there cannot exist a closed definition of art considering the creativity and variation of modern art; which leads to a second conclusion, Dickie’s argument for an institutional theory of art must make us skeptical of the feasibility of defining the classificatory sense of art that takes into account all of the radical creativity, adventuresomeness and exuberance of art and all its forms that may result from the artworld. As appealing as Dickie’s argument may be, the conditionality for the classification of an object as a work of art skirts close to an open concept of art that a closed definition of a work of art seems arbitrary and borderless. Closing the definition in this way, in fact, opens the classification completely.</p>
