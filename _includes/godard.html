<h2>End of Godardian Cinema</h2>

					<p>Godard’s <i>Weekend</i> (1967) marks a distinct turning point in his films. From 1967 and on, Godard is primarily concerned with political activism and less concerned about all other cinematic considerations. The Godard that was in love with the cinema was dead and a new filmmaker that relished in long takes, weak narratives and flamboyance was born; his films after <i>Weekend</i> continued to dissolve narrative and conventional structure and relied on political commentary and stripping visual from audio. <i>Weekend</i> marks this transition most paradigmatically. </p>

					<p>The film plot, what there is of one, revolves around a couple that is totally opposed to each other, attempting to gain inheritance of a dying family member. Godard is not as concerned with the plot as much as he is concerned with interrupting the audience with intertitles and interjecting linguistic puns both visually and aurally. Dixon explains, “the slight narrative is little more than a frame for a series of sight gags, street theatre and stylistic flourishes which both celebrate and mock the death of conventional image production system of the contemporary commercial success” (89). The death of conventional cinema was an important view of Godard’s. ‘Fin de cinema’ flashes across the screen at the end of the film. It is not just the end of the film but the end of cinema as we know it. A hitchhiking prophet meets the couple about halfway through the film and tells them: “I am here to proclaim to these modern times the end of the grammatically era and the beginning of an age of flamboyance in every field, especially in movies.” The hitchhiker’s prophecy essentially describes <i>Weekend</i> and it “seems to suggest that the grammatical era may indeed be having its apocalypse even as we watch” (Sterritt, 104) as Godard begins to usher flamboyance into cinema.</p>

					<p>One aspect of Godard’s <i>Weekend</i> that defies grammatical convention is the use of Brechtian device to distance the viewer from the film and remind the audience they are watching a film. Godard does this in several ways. The film starts with glaring titles and makes use of them throughout the film. In the infamous car wreck scene, the camera tracks for nearly an entire reel of film uncut. Instead of giving the scene a solid visual dominion of the film, to allow the audience to lose itself in the absurdity of the scene, Godard interjects titles letting the audience know the time of day. The intertitles are pointless; we do not need to know what time of day it is but Godard uses them not to let us now the time, but to remind us of the film and distance us from the scene.</p>

					<p>Several scenes of confrontation between other characters are visually distanced from the audience. At the beginning of the film, two cars get in a minor wreck and the event escalades quickly into a fight. The entire scene is shot from a balcony and it never becomes clear who was involved of why it turned to be such a big deal. Godard asks the audience to realize the scene’s absurdity and use of the colors of the French flag in an omniscient, balcony view. Later, there is another accident. The accident and resulting argument takes place almost entirely off-screen as Roland and Corinne sit in their vehicle watching. Only until the end of the argument do we get to see what the argument is over: a Parisian’s totaled sport luxury car and a laborer’s tractor. </p>

					<p>Another scene in which Godard distances the audience through visuals is not a car accident, but a recollection of an orgy. Corinne has a secret lover and, in great detail, describes her latest sexual threesome to him. The scene typically would appeal to a French audience used to nudity in the theatres but Godard shoots the scene poorly lit and uncut. The female character is barely visible and the camera does not bother to move from its position. Intentionally, Godard tries to bore the audience with dialogue and lack of a sex scene by shooting the scene the way he did. This technique distances an audience used to nudity, sex and the appeal of it in film.</p>

					<p>Godard also has characters talking directly at the camera, breaking the ‘fourth wall’ between the actors and the audience. Instead of existing within the film itself, characters directly confront audiences and are paradoxically distanced from the film even when drawn into it. The characters of the film not only talk to the audience like they know they are a part in the film, but they also talk to each other like they are acting in a film. Roland makes a comment when encountering the two characters in the woods: “What a rotten film! There are only crazy people.” And later, Corinne asks the driver of a car if she was acting in the film or if she was part of real life. The characters know they are part of this apocalyptic end of the grammatical era the hitchhiker prophesied and they are trying to escape it. No one is safe. In this way, Godard is not only poking fun at the hippies, capitalists, Marxists but also himself. </p>

					<p>This flamboyant world that put an end to the tyranny of convention is even begrudged by the characters that exist in it. Roland and Corinne try to escape it and get the inheritance money for themselves but they are continuously interrupted (as we, the audience, are continuously) by a world full of crazy people and those acting in the film. Ironically, Roland and Corinne are just two more in the world of crazy people and, as we know, are also actors in the movie. By the end of the film, Corinne eats her husband while in the hands of a group of hippy cannibalistic revolutionaries. The irony is that their weekend is not the end of their week, but the end of world as they knew it: the world of cinema.</p>
